<p>Forms are very useful in any web application. Unlike angular and angularjs, that gives form validation out of the box. You have to handle forms yourself in React. This brought about many complications like how to get form values, how do I manage form state, how do I validate my form on the fly and show validation messages. There are different methods and libraries out there to help with this but if you are like me that hates dependent on too many libraries, welcome on board, We are going to bootstrap our own form from the ground up.</p>
